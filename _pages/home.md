I am a **Robotics Engineer and Junior Researcher** currently bridging the gap between advanced mathematical control theory and real-world embedded implementation. 

My work focuses on giving aerial systems the "sense of touch" through **Robust Force Control** and optimizing autonomy using **Reinforcement Learning**.[1] I am currently a PhD candidate in a dual-degree program (Cotutelle) between **Cinvestav (Mexico)** and **Heudiasyc - UTC (France)**.

### Core Competencies

| Domain | Skills & Tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Robotics Control** | Robust Control, PID, MPC, Sliding Mode, Lyapunov Stability |
| **Embedded Systems** | C++, Embedded Linux, Multi-threading, Pixhawk, ArduPilot |
| **AI & Learning** | Python (PyTorch), Reinforcement Learning (Actor-Critic) |
| **Mechanical Design** | SolidWorks (CSWP Certified), Rapid Prototyping |

### Current Research
At **Heudiasyc**, I am working on the cooperative interaction of heterogeneous robots, developing constrained model frameworks that allow drones and ground vehicles to collaborate in complex environments.
