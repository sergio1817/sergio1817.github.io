excerpt: "Robotics Engineer & PhD Researcher bridging Control Theory and Embedded Systems."
---

I am a **Robotics Engineer and Researcher** specializing in the intersection of mathematical control theory and real-world embedded implementation.

Currently, I am a PhD candidate in a dual-degree program (**Cotutelle**) between [Cinvestav](https://www.cinvestav.mx/) (Mexico) and(https://www.hds.utc.fr/) (France). My research focuses on giving aerial systems the "sense of touch" through **Robust Force Control** [1] and optimizing autonomous behavior using **Reinforcement Learning**.

I translate complex control algorithms (Lyapunov, MPC) into reliable **C++ code** for embedded Linux platforms.

### Core Competencies

| Domain | Skills & Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Robotics Control** | Robust Control, PID, NMPC, Sliding Mode, Lyapunov Stability |
| **Embedded Systems** | C++, Embedded Linux, Multi-threading, Pixhawk, ArduPilot |
| **AI & Learning** | Python (PyTorch), Reinforcement Learning (Actor-Critic) |
| **Mechanical Design** | SolidWorks (CSWP Certified), Hardware Integration |
| **Languages** | Spanish (Native), English (Professional), French (Intermediate) |

### Current Research
At **Heudiasyc**, I am working on the cooperative interaction of heterogeneous robots, developing constrained model frameworks that allow drones and ground vehicles to collaborate in complex environments.
