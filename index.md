excerpt: "Robotics Engineer & Researcher specialized in Aerial Systems."
---

I am a **Robotics Engineer and Junior Researcher** bridging the gap between advanced mathematical control theory and real-world embedded implementation.

Currently, I am a PhD candidate in a **Cotutelle (Dual-Degree)** program between **Cinvestav (Mexico)** and **Heudiasyc - UTC (France)**. My research focuses on giving aerial systems the "sense of touch" through **Robust Force Control** and optimizing autonomy using **Reinforcement Learning**.

### Core Competencies

| Domain | Skills & Tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Robotics Control** | Robust Control, MPC, Sliding Mode, Lyapunov Stability |
| **Embedded Systems** | C++, Embedded Linux, Multi-threading, Pixhawk, ArduPilot |
| **AI & Learning** | Python (PyTorch), Reinforcement Learning (Actor-Critic) |
| **Mechanical Design** | SolidWorks (CSWP Certified), Rapid Prototyping |

### Current Research
At **Heudiasyc**, I am working on the **cooperative interaction of heterogeneous robots**, developing constrained model frameworks that allow drones and ground vehicles to collaborate in complex environments.
